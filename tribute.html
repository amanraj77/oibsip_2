Born on April 19, 1957, in Aden, Yemen, Ambani is the son of the late Dhirubhai Ambani, the founder of Reliance Industries, and Kokilaben Ambani. He completed his bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Mumbai and went on to pursue an MBA from Stanford University in the United States.</p>
